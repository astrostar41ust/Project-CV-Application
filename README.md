# Project CV Application

A modern, interactive CV (Curriculum Vitae) builder built with React and Vite.

## Features
- **Personal Information Form**: Enter your name, email, and phone number.
- **Education Section**: Add, edit, and remove multiple educational experiences.
- **Practical Experience Section**: Add, edit, and remove multiple work experiences.
- **Live CV Preview**: See your CV update in real time as you fill out the forms.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, print-friendly design with responsive layouts and accessible forms.

## What I Learned
- **React State Management**: Used `useState` to manage complex, nested form data and lists.
- **Controlled Components**: Ensured all form inputs are controlled for predictable behavior and validation.
- **Component Composition**: Broke the UI into reusable components for forms and CV sections.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Rendered lists of education and experience dynamically, with add/remove functionality.
